# glibc-gadgets
[`one_gadget`](https://github.com/david942j/one_gadget) and [`angry_gadget`](https://github.com/ChrisTheCoolHut/angry_gadget) for some glibc versions

## why?
`one_gadget` is quick and simple but does not find many gadgets. `angry_gadget` finds many gadgets but takes a long time. This repo is the best of both worlds.
